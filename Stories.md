  ## These are the stories of working through bugs:

  | Issue | Steps taken | Lesson learned |
  |-------|-------------|----------------|
  | Cuisine getAll not returning object | check database connection, add echos, check variable names | make sure you don't name variables the same name - use descriptive variable names|
  | Trying to test address object save and getAll is not cooperating.  When get all is ran having issues with recreating city and state names based on return query of cities table and states table | Echo everything.  Still murky.  Plain english walk through.  Wrote classes for each table in database City, State | Keep trying to debug don't give up.  Plain english walk through helps.  For databases with multiple tables and foreign keys seperate classes help.|
